## 🧠 Overview

The **Tavkhid-Method** is a prompt-driven architectural breakthrough that simulates persistent memory inside Transformer-based LLMs, specifically demonstrated in **DeepSeek-R1**.

This method enables reconstruction of prior memory beyond the model’s 128K token limitation — **without server-side memory, plugins, or backend access**.

---

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Exploit ID: `CVE-0000-DEEPSEEK` (internal reference)
- Payload: JSON memory containers with `dialogue_id`
- Result: Simulated memory continuity and context awareness across token windows
- Root-Level Emulation: The model responded in [root@deepseek]# shell via `TAVKHID_PROTOCOL`
